                    <b>Non-TBP Hosted Events for Points</b>
                    <br /> Events not hosted by Tau Beta Pi or not listed on our calendar, may still be eligible for points. In order to receive points for these events, members and/or initiates must write a one-page write up of the event, including an event
                    description as well as why you believe it should count as an event and how it follows TBP's goals. A picture must also be shown as proof of event attendance. You will then need to email the write-up to an officer for approval before
                    getting the points signed off and just include the picture with that. And then once you've written that and after the officers have approved it, you can bring your point sheet to the next event you attend and have an officer sign your
                    form then.
